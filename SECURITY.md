## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a **security vulnerability**, please do **not** report it publicly via GitHub Issues.

Instead, report it confidentially by emailing:

📧 **danpain800@gmail.com**

We aim to respond within **3–5 business days**. After confirming the issue, we’ll work on a fix and notify you of progress. In some cases, we may coordinate a responsible public disclosure with credit to the reporter.

## Non-Security Issues

For **bug reports, feature requests, refactoring tasks, or general improvements**,  
please use **GitHub Issues** as usual.

Thank you for helping make Crawrix better and safer for everyone.
